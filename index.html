	<p> Hello, and welcome to Dhrumil's GitHub lesson. If you haven't already, please
	Welcome to a whimsical corner of the internet! This site is a playful experiment in creative writing, humor, and absurdity. Here, you'll find an intentionally over-the-top article about vegetables (and, for some reason, gym socks) that's riddled with amusing errors and quirky observations. Whether you're here by accident or curiosity, this page is meant to entertain, confuse, and possibly make you question the very fabric of online content. Dive in and enjoy the chaos!
	</p>

	<p> This is a pretend article about vegetables. Specifically how long they are and what color they are. There are lots of vegetables in the world and they are of various colors. They can be white, blue or yellow; but there are no neon vegetables in nature. That is why this article is so important to inform you about types of vegetables. Once you're done reading, you should be able to identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable. </p>


	<!-- This is a placeholder for the table of vegetables.-->
	<h5> Vegetables on my shopping list. </h5>
	<div id='veggiestable'></div>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let's talk about potatoes. Your average potato is 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. Of course, there are various types of potatoes, but if you took every single potato of every size, shape and variety, they are roughly that size on average. Additionally, most potatoes are brown. Some are white and some are yellow; some are sweet and some are mellow. But potatoes are potatoes and on average they are brown. </p>


	<p> Now let's talk about gym socks. Gym socks are very smelly. So smelly in fact that they make your feet smell bad. Actually, I think that it is the other way around. Feet actually imbue the smell into the socks; the socks are not actually the source of the smell. Did you know that? Go figure! </p>

	<p> Now carrots, those are orange. Did you know that <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/health/food-and-nutrition/purple-carrots-21032011/">carrots actually used to be purple? </a></p>

	<p> In conclusion, carrots used to be purple and you now know the average length of a potato. But you don't know the distribution of potato lengths or how the length differs by potato type. I hope you can now identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable.</p>

	<p> If you're reading this, you've reached the end of the article and probably lost a few brain cells. Now we, a group of professional newspeople, are going to work on improving it. Kind of like a reverse mad-libs. </p>
